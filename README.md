# Crypto Analytics Dashboard

## Project Overview
The Crypto Analytics Dashboard is a web application for tracking cryptocurrency wallet balances and transactions. It allows users to connect their cryptocurrency wallets, fetch wallet details, and view transaction history in a user-friendly interface. Integrating with various Ethereum networks, users can easily switch between mainnet and testnets (Ropsten and Rinkeby). The application utilizes WalletConnect for seamless wallet connections and management.
